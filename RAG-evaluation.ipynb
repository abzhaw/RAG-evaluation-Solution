Be aware that even if examination results are normal, the person may still have asthma.\\n\\n2. **Initial treatment and objective tests for acute symptoms at presentation**:\\n   - Treat people immediately if they are acutely unwell or highly symptomatic at presentation.\\n   - Perform objective tests that may help support a diagnosis of asthma, such as:\\n     - Eosinophil count (the number of eosinophils in a blood sample)\\n     - Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)\\n     - Spirometry (measuring the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in one second, known as FEV1)\\n     - Peak expiratory flow (PEF) before and after bronchodilator\\n   - If objective tests cannot be done immediately, carry them out when acute symptoms have been controlled, and advise people to contact their healthcare professional immediately if they become unwell while waiting.\\n\\n3. **Bronchial challenge test**: A test to measure airway responsiveness (bronchial responsiveness). It involves giving small increments of a bronchoconstrictor (most commonly methacholine) and measuring the FEV1 after each dose until it falls by a predetermined amount (usually 20% from baseline).\\n\\n4. **Bronchodilator reversibility**: A measure of the ability to reverse obstruction in the airways using medicines that widen the airways (bronchodilators).\\n\\n5. **Other tests**: Depending on the individual's history, other tests may be performed, such as a bronchial hypresponsiveness test or a leukotriene receptor antagonist test.\\n\\nIt's essential to note that the results of spirometry and FeNO tests may be affected in people who have been treated with inhaled corticosteroids (the test results are more likely to be normal).\",\n",
